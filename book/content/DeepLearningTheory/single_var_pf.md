# Single vatiable expression for $S$ in the case of zero-mean activation functions

See the page {doc}`pf`. 

It turns out that, at least in the case of zero-mean activation functions, it is possible to derive an effective action that depends only on a single variable. In particular, it is not necessary to introduce the variables $Q$ and its conjugate $\bar{Q}$ as done in {doc}`pf`.

The single variable expression follows from an integral identity for gamma distribution (in the single hidden layer case), and in particular using the moment generating function / Laplace transform of a gamma distribution:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{}{\Gamma()}
\end{equation}

We can restart the calculation from:
